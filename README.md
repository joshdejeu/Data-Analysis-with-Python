# Data Analysis with Python Certificate

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for the Data Analysis with Python certificate from FreeCodeCamp. The certificate covers a comprehensive set of video courses created by Santiago Basulto. These courses guide you through the entire process of data analysis, including reading data from various sources (CSV, SQL, Excel), processing data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualizing it using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Additionally, the repository includes a thorough Jupyter Notebook course and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.
